# BestPositionsFM
This program helps you in selecting the ideal position for a scouted player in FM. 
>P.S. Under development. Squad players cannot be tested through the program for now.

### Overview
Although it is clear from the attributes screen which position is the best for the player, yet if you're someone like me who admires the beauty of data and boundless possibilities (lol), you're at the right place. This tool (under development) will help you analyse the player's ability in **all** positions and roles available in the game!

### Insight
A player whose all attributes are known, i.e. 90+ knowledge level of the player is required to run this program. The program might be developed to predict best positions for players whose knowledge is not complete, in the future.  

The algorithm is set up in such a way that "key" attributes related to a player's position and role are prioritised. The value of the "secondary" attributes is no less than 75% of its initial value.

### Usage
- While in the game, go to a player's default attributes view 
- `cmd/ctrl` + `P` and save it as `Tect File` into the `players` folder
- run the `bestpos.py` script and enter the name with which you saved the file
- the program will showcase the best list of positions for the player, with a score
