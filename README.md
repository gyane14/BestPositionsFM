# BestPositionsFM

#### Have you ever tried to train a player outside of natural position and don't know what to expect?  
As a FM player you might already know by now that the *ability stars do lie!* But guess what, the **numbers don't**. This program helps you tackle this exact situation by providing you a list of the best roles and duties for the selected squad (or fully scouted) player. 

### Overview
Although it is clear from the attributes screen which position is the best for the player, yet if you're someone like me (and many others) who admires the beauty of data and boundless possibilities *(lol)*, you're at the right place. This tool *(under development)* will help you analyse the player's ability in **all** positions, roles and duties available in the game!

### Insight
A player whose all attributes are known, *i.e. 90+ knowledge level of the player or a squad player* is required to run this program. The program might be developed to predict best positions for players whose knowledge is not complete, in the future.  

The algorithm is set up in such a way that "key" attributes related to a player's position and role are prioritised. The value of the "secondary" attributes is no less than 80% of its initial value.

### Usage
- While in the game, go to a player's default attributes view 
- `cmd/ctrl` + `P` and save it as `Text File` into (this) `/players` folder
- run the `main.py` script and enter the *name* with which you saved the file
- the program will showcase the best list of positions, roles and duties for the player, with an *aggregate score*
